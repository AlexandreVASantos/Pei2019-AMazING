Discussion on the overall architecture and first draft of MVP (Minimum Viable Product). During the last days of the week we started to getting used to Django, our choice of web framework to the web app, REST, SDN and OpenFlow.</p>

						<h2>Week 4<h2>
						<h3>04-03-2019 to 10-03-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">This week there wasn't a team meeting due to incompabilities, however some work was done.Some nodes had OS (Operating System) already, 
						however we didn't know the credentials, so we started to do clean OS install in some off them, since it will have to be done for all. 
						We chose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, however it had to be instalated via dist upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 because the APU Board didn't allow us to install Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 directly, maybe because of USB pen configuration, we will try later to resolve this problem due to better security, bug fix and longer 
						support in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. In addition to documentation that we also complete, some front end has done.</p>

						<h2>Week 5<h2>
						<h3>11-03-2019 to 17-03-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">During week 5 we found that there was a lack of material, either the material simply didn't arrive or it was being used on other projects, making them impossible to install on the grid. Needing to take care of the nodes being used later, together with the fact that some fans cables were not weld or insecure, we're expecting a major setback in our scheduling. Nevertheless, we kept installing OS in the remaining nodes, making two of them 100% complete and able to fullfill the needs of our sub tasks like testing the Web App and the Daemon. We also discovered that our switch, an Aruba J9727A, had a REST API and we will try to explore that feature.

						<h2>Week 6<h2>
						<h3>18-03-2019 to 24-03-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">
						During week 6 our main goal has to achieve full connectivity between the Web App REST server and the Node REST server, so we tested it out:
						we connected two pcs, one for each individual REST server, and executed multiple requests between machines being most of them successful. 
						In addition to that, we kept installing OS in the remaining nodes and we started the switch controller. Unfortunately, the Aruba REST API
						is not installed in the switch and we need to balance the pros and cons of installing it, since the switch is the main piece of this 
						project and we need its stability. In the weekly team meeting, thursday day 21, we decided as a first aproach to simplify the daemon to
						directly call commands via shell but to upgrade it as soon as we have results to use a library in python or C to do that, libnl and
						nl80211 respectively.

						<h2>Week 7<h2>
						<h3>25-03-2019 to 31-04-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">
						This team meeting served to talk about the last details of MVP, discussed how much percentage of final product MVP is and possible extras. We also aproach
						the security details inherent to the project, of course we don't want to make possible a breach of security that leads to credentials stolen. 
						Although this is a must, will not be implemented in a first version. In the other days of the week we continued to develop not only the Web App but also 
						Daemon and the Switch Controller. We are still trying to assemble nodes since some material are lacking like eletrical plug to use to connect the fans to the
						motherboard. After they arrive some nodes can be put in place and we can start to begin the tests.

						<h2>Week 8<h2>
						<h3>1-04-2019 to 7-04-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">Week 8 was more a quiet week since we tried to fix previous errors and discussed the workflow of both web apps. We started to think further and implemented
						error checking, prevention and avoidance in order to let the user always know what is the state of the system. In the weekly meeting with the mentor we discussed about loggers and the possibility 
						to display information in graphics using Elasticsearch.</p>

						<h2>Week 9<h2>

						<p style="font-size: 140%">During week 9, from monday to wednesday, we dedicated more time to the course presentation and not much was done, but we still continued to improve our apps working on the missing menus. Most of the people finds hard to understand the concept within networks since most of the 
						time it is not a visible thing, either it works or not, and so during the weekly team meeting our mentors mentioned other ways to make people fully understand our work. </p>

						<h2>Week 10<h2>
						<h3>15-04-2019 to 21-04-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">During week 10 we updated our switch software to fulfill our needs, since the new software has a REST API that can directly interact with the controller app. We also started to 
						search for new approaches to make the user experience the best we can get and with as much information as possible. </p>

						<h2>Week 11<h2>
						<h3>22-04-2019 to 28-04-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">Since we have a lot of hardware where we need to have our software, 24 nodes to be exact, week 11 served to develop a few scripts to autonomously install requirements, needed packages and perform configurations
						needed. We also run scripts in 1 one and virtual machines to test them and change them if one thing was not 100% what we want. We also updated the database to receive alarm messages
						from the lm-sensors, a package that reads hardware sensors information and trigger alarm messages if values are not expected.</p>

						<h2>Week 12<h2>
						<h3>29-04-2019 to 05-05-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">Since we are approaching the final month of work we started to trim the final edges and began the test phase which is so important to connect 
						work from all groups ( Daemon, Controller app and Node Config App). We discovered some bugs when deploying software on the nodes and then correct them to fulfill our needs. Every week we try to add more features to our apps and make the user experience the best we can, with that being sad we now want to deploy or work on the rooftop and deploy our apps in the IT network or equivalent to finish our testing phase and have a full operational system. </p>

						<h2>Week 13<h2>
						<h3>06-05-2019 to 12-05-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">As we said in the previous weeks every week during the team meeting with mentors we talk about different aproaches and more features and this week wasn't an exception.
						We discussed the possibility of a dashboard to the switch controller app so the amazing manager easily gets track of the nodes on and alerts of each easily.
						We also run some tests that consisted in create access points and connect to them and also did some alterations on scripts for software on nodes since we keep adding features and need to be up to date to automate the process.</p>

					<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 gtco-heading text-center">
						<h2>Week 14<h2>
						<h3>13-04-2019 to 19-05-2019</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 140%">In the weekly team meeting we discussed about the use of grafana in addition to elastic search, but at this point it is tricky to implement that because 
						elastic search uses a NoSQL database and elastic search queries in grafana require a learning curve that we will not have time to achieve. We also talked about the possibility to use
						the broker from the Node Config App also for the nodes itself, which means instead of the nodes comunicate directly with node config app, sending hardware alert messages and messages saying that 
						the node is alive, it sends that to the broker and the app acts like a consumer, which probably generates the same traffic but the traffic is more concentrated on the kafka server instead of going for several parts.
						With that being said we started to implemment all of this and keep running tests for in the end everything is running properly.</p>
